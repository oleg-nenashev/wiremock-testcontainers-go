This module allows provisioning the [WireMock API mock server](https://wiremock.org/) as a standalone container within your unit tests,
based on the official [WireMock Docker](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock-docker) images (`2.35.0-1` or above) or compatible custom images.

You can learn more about WireMock and Golang on this [WireMock solutions page](https://wiremock.org/docs/solutions/golang/).

## Supported features

The following features are now explicitly included in the module's API:

- Passing API Mapping files
- Passing Resource files

More features will be added over time.

## Quick Start

See the [Quick Start Guide](./docs/quickstart.md).
Just a teaser of how it feels at the real speed!

## Requirements

- Golang version 1.17 or above, so all modern Golang projects should be compatible with it.
- The module supports the official [WireMock Docker](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock-docker) images 2.35.0-1 or above.
- Custom images are supported too as long as they follow the same CLI and API structure.

## Usage

```golang
import (
 "context"
 "github.com/pkg/errors"
 . "github.com/wiremock/wiremock-testcontainers-go"
 "io"
 http "net/http"
 "path/filepath"
 "testing"
)

func TestWireMock(t *testing.T) {
 // Create Container
 ctx := context.Background()
 container, err := RunContainer(ctx,
  WithMappingFile("hello", filepath.Join("testdata", "hello-world.json")),
 )
 if err != nil {
  t.Fatal(err)
 }

 // Clean up the container after the test is complete
 t.Cleanup(func() {
  if err := container.Terminate(ctx); err != nil {
   t.Fatalf("failed to terminate container: %s", err)
  }
 })

 // Send the HTTP GET request
 uri, err := GetURI(ctx, container)
 if err != nil {
  t.Fatal(err, "unable to get container endpoint")
 }
 statusCode, out, err := SendHttpGet(uri, "/hello")
 if err != nil {
  t.Fatal(err, "Failed to get a response")
 }

 // Verify the response
 if statusCode != 200 {
  t.Fatalf("expected HTTP-200 but got %d", statusCode)
 }
 if string(out) != "Hello, world!" {
  t.Fatalf("expected 'Hello, world!' but got %v", string(out))
 }
}
```
